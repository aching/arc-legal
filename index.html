    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <p>Arc is a personal task management app. Your privacy matters, and the app is designed with a local-first approach.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your tasks, schedules, and settings are stored locally on your device and synced via Apple's CloudKit to your personal iCloud account. Your data stays within Apple's ecosystem and is not sent to any third-party servers.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect analytics or usage data.</li>
        <li>We do not use third-party tracking or advertising frameworks.</li>
        <li>We do not sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties.</li>
        <li>We do not require an account beyond your Apple ID for iCloud sync.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CloudKit & iCloud</h2>
    <p>Arc uses Apple's CloudKit service to sync your tasks across your devices and to enable task sharing with trusted contacts. All data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is subject to Apple's privacy policy and security practices.</p>

    <h2>Task Sharing</h2>
    <p>If you choose to share tasks with other users, only the specific task data you share is made accessible to the people you invite. Sharing is managed through Apple's CloudKit sharing infrastructure. You control who has access and can revoke it at any time.</p>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>Arc may request access to the following, only when you use features that require them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contacts</strong> &mdash; To link tasks to contacts and manage follow-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar</strong> &mdash; To display upcoming events alongside your tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> &mdash; To trigger location-based task reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong> &mdash; To send task reminders and due date alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> &mdash; To attach photos to tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone &amp; Speech Recognition</strong> &mdash; For voice-based task entry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke any of these permissions at any time in your device's Settings app.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Arc is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
